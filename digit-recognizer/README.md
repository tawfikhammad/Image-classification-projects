# digit-recognizer-project
This repository contains the notebook I used to built a deep learning model for recognizing handwritten digits.

## Data

The notebook uses the popular MNIST dataset, which consists of 42000 training images and 28000 test images of handwritten digits. The dataset is widely used for digit recognition tasks and serves as a benchmark for evaluating model performance.

* The data from [digit-recognizer competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer)

* [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tawfikelmetwally/mnist-digit-recognizer-99-38-accuracy?scriptVersionId=143790283) my kaggle notebook


## Files

The repository contains the following files:

**`digit_recognizer.ipynb`**: This Jupyter notebook provides the code and instructions for building and training a digit recognition model.

**`submission.csv`**: This file is an example submission file that I used as a submission to a digit recognition competition or evaluate the model's performance. 

**`images`**: This directory contains images used in the Jupyter notebook for visualizations and examples.
