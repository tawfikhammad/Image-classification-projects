# rock-paper-scissors-project
This repository contains the notebook I used to built a rock paper scissors classification model.

## Data

The data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/frtgnn/rock-paper-scissor), click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/frtgnn/rock-paper-scissor/download?datasetVersionNumber=1) to download the data.

* [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tawfikelmetwally/image-classification-accuracy-98-4/notebook) my kaggle notebook
  
**Note:**
  
1- Scissors gives you this array  `[0,0,1]`

2 Rock gives you this array  `[0,1,0]`

3- Papper gives you this array `[1,0,0]`
